The [Ultimate Certamen Library (UCL)](https://www.certamenlibrary.org/) is a database of Certamen questions.

You can search by tournament name, level, and year. Click on a row to view the PDF of the tournament.

You can also search rounds by keywords. The results will only contain rounds that include all terms used in the search. You can wrap words around quotation marks to ensure that they are in close proximityâ€”for example, I would search "Sallust Historiae" to find tossups about Sallust's Historiae (as opposed to other authors, e.g. Ennius).

If you have any rounds you'd like me to add, please send me an email at jinwoo.kim@yale.edu. Thanks!
